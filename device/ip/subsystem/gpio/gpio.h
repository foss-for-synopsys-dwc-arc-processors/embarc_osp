  IO_SET_CB_RX                  io_cb_t         Callback function invoked from ISR whenever the interrupt is triggered on one of
                                                GPIO inputs configured to operate as interrupts. The callback's argument is initialized
                                                with bitmask where each bit represents corresponding GPIO signal and is set to 1 if
                                                that signal raises interrupt.
  IO_GPIO_SET_DIRECTION         uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value controls the direction of the corresponding GPIO signal as follows:
                                                0 - input, 1 - output. Default value of the control is zero that corresponds to all signals are inputs
                                                on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_SET_INT_ENABLE        uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specifies if corresponding GPIO input shall act as interrupt or as a normal
  (IO_GPIO_GET_INT_ENABLE)                      GPIO signal as follows: 0 - normal signal, 1 - interrupt. Default value of the control is zero that corresponds
                                                to all inputs are normal GPIO signals on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_SET_INT_MASK          uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specifies if corresponding GPIO interrupt signal is masked:
  (IO_GPIO_GET_INT_MASK)                        0 - unmasked, 1 - masked. Default value of the control is zero that corresponds to
                                                all interrupts are unmasked on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_SET_INT_TYPE          uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specifies the type of corresponding GPIO interrupt as follows:
                                                0 - level-sensitive, 1 - edge-sensitive. Default value of the control is zero that corresponds to
                                                all interrupts are level-sensitive on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_SET_INT_POLARITY      uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specifies the polarity of corresponding GPIO interrupt as follows:
                                                0 - active-low (falling edge), 1 - active-high(raising edge). Default value of the control is zero
                                                that corresponds to all interrupts are active-low on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_SET_INT_BOTHEDGE      uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specifies the type of corresponding GPIO interrupt as follows:
                                                0 - interrupt defined by INT_TYPE and INT_POLARITY, 1 - interrupt edge sensitive for both rising and falling edge
                                                that corresponds to all interrupts are defined by INT_TYPE and INT_POLARITY.
  IO_GPIO_SET_DEBOUNCE          uint32_t        Bitmask, where each bit's value specify if corresponding GPIO signal configured as interrupt source needs
                                                to be debounced as follows: 0 - no debounce, 1 - enable debounce. Default value of the control is zero
                                                that corresponds to all GPIO signals aren't debounced on device opening.
  IO_GPIO_GET_DIRECTION     uint32_t    Same as IO_GPIO_SET_DIRECTION.
  IO_GPIO_GET_GPO       uint32_t    Last value written to the port data register using io_gpio_write() service, does not depend on GPIO direction
                        settings and can be different compare to data returened by io_gpio_read() service.
