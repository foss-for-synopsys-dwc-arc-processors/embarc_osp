<para>The processor timers include two independent 32-bit timers and a 64-bit real-time counter (RTC). Timer 0 and timer 1 are identical in operation. The only difference is that these timers are connected to different interrupts. The Timers cannot be included in a configuration without interrupts. Each timer is optional and when present, it is connected to a fixed interrupt; interrupt 16 for timer 0 and interrupt 17 for timer 1. The processor timers are connected to a system clock signal that operates even when the ARCv2-based processor is in the sleep state. The timers can be used to generate interrupt signals that wake the processor from SLEEP state.</para><para>The processor timers automatically reset and restart their operation after reaching the limit value. The processor timers can be programmed to count only the clock cycles when the processor is not halted. The processor timers can also be programmed to generate an interrupt or to generate a system Reset upon reaching the limit value.</para><para>The 64-bit RTC does not generate any interrupts. This timer is used to count the clock cycles automatically. </para>    </detaileddescription>
