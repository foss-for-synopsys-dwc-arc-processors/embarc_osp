FPGA
^^^^

The FPGA on the |emsdp| board is configured by storing an FPGA bitstream into the configuration memory of the |emsdp|.
Drag-and-drop feature enable users to copy an FPGA bitstream from the PC to the configuration memory and programmed into the FPGA.

Memory
^^^^^^

Please refer to `ARC_EM_SDP_User Guide` for memory map and more details.

Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^

|emsdp| board provides a variety set of peripherals for evaluate and development.
There are many peripheral devices available, such as SPI, IIC, UART, GPIO.
Upon these, the |emsdp| offers multiple interfaces for audio, USB, micro-SD card, wireless, ADC, motion sensor, etc.
External hardware modules can also be easily connected to the board though extension interfaces using Pmod Connectors, Arduino, mikro BUS.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

To bring your application context around the |emsdp|, Pmod Connectors, Arduino, mikro BUS are supported.
All the sets of connections are controlled by mux controller and can be switched by user.
There are many peripheral devices available, such as SPI, IIC, UART, GPIO.

Usage
-----

Setting Up
^^^^^^^^^^
You can use either USB-JTAG or USB-UART interface to communicate with |emsdp| board.
Before the interfaces are used, you must install the required drivers on the computer where you intend to run
the MetaWare debugger or other serial debug consoles (such as PuTTY or other hyper-terminals).

The driver is a part of the Digilent Adept tool. You can download the most recent version of
the Digilent Adept tool from the `Digilent website <https://store.digilentinc.com>`_, and follow the installation instructions provided by Digilent.

You may also skip this step if you are using default settings.

.. note:: Learn more about programming FPGA device in `ARC_EM_SDP_UserGuide`

Package Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section talks about how to add new |emsdp| cores into embARC OSP. Please notice that the existing em11d_dfss core configure files are for test and example purpose, we strongly suggest you to follow the steps in this section.

#. You may download the package from our website: `DesignWare ARC EM Software Development Platform <https://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=arc-em-software-development-platform>`_. Suppose you want to add a new package called ``em11d_dfss``, then the name of your downloaded package would be ``emsdp_em11d_dfss.zip``.

#. Unzip the .zip file, you will find four folders: ``/doc``, ``/fpga``, ``/include``, ``/tool_config``. Now create a new folder according to your board revision and package name. In this case *em11d_dfss* is added to *rev2* board, so you should set your directory as this:``/board/emsdp/rev2/configs/em11d_dfss``

#. Copy the contents of unzipped folder to ``/board/emsdp/rev2/configs/em11d_dfss``. It would be like:

    .. code-block:: console

        em11d_dfss
        ├─doc
        ├─fpga
        ├─include
        └─tool_config


#. You are done importing a new package, flash the bit file into your board and then build with it to make sure everything is working.

Build and Run Your First Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By setting up the board, you are now ready to run your first program on |emsdp|. There are two way to run your program.
The first way is to use debugger, please refer to example `example_blinky` for further details. Build and download the example using either MetaWare or GNU. The command is shown below:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd <embarc_root>/example/baremetal/blinky
        $ gmake BOARD=emsdp BD_VER=rev2 CORE=em11d_dfss TOOLCHAIN=mw run

.. note:: Notice that for CORE option there are multiple core choices, please check `<embarc_root>/board/emsdp/rev2` folder for available cores.

The second way is to use a micro-SD card, the bootloader on |emsdp| is capable to find and run prebuilt bin file that is named as ``app.bin``.
Build the example using either MetaWare or GNU with the command shown below:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd <embarc_root>/example/baremetal/blinky
        $ gmake BOARD=emsdp BD_VER=rev2 CORE=em11d_dfss TOOLCHAIN=mw bin

After building succeed, you will find ``blinky_mw_em11d_dfss.bin`` at ``<embarc_root>/example/baremetal/blinky/obj_emsdp_rev2/mw_em11d_dfss``. Rename the bin file to ``app.bin`` and copy to the root directory of a micro-SD card. Insert the micro-SD card to |emsdp| board and press start button to run.

Development Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please refer to `Developer Guides`.
You may need to specify peripheral driver (`<embarc_root>/device/peripheral`) for your own code.

For example, if Wi-Fi rs9113 driver is needed, add this line in makefile:

    .. code-block:: console

        EXT_DEV_LIST += wifi/rs9113

Another example is to add both wifi driver and audio codec driver for an online audio application:

    .. code-block:: console

        EXT_DEV_LIST += wifi/rs9113 audio/max9880a
