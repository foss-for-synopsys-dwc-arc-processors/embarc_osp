ARC EM Starter Kit
==================

Introduction
------------

The DesignWare® ARC® EM Starter Kit (EMSK, emsk) enables rapid
software development, code porting, software debugging, and profiling for ARC
EM4, EM6 (EMSK 1.1), EM5D, EM7D, EM9D and EM11D (EMSK 2.3) processors.

.. Note::
	Caches are not integrated in EM5D and EM9D configurations. If program code runs in DDR memory, SPI and IIC devices should run at a slower frequency.
	EMSK 1.0 must be upgraded to EMSK 1.1 using EMSK 1.1's firmware, EMSK 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 must be upgraded to EMSK 2.3 using EMSK 2.3's firmware.


The EMSK consists of a hardware platform and a software package, including
pre-installed FPGA images of different configurations of the ARC EM Processor
with peripherals.

The development board is based on a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA. It
supports hardware extensions using six 2x6 connectors supporting a total of 48
user I/O pins (plus power and ground pins) that can be used to connect
components such as sensors, actuators, memories, displays, buttons, switches,
and communication devices. A Digilent Pmod™ compatible extension board
containing a four-channel 12-bit A/D converter with an IIC interface and an AC
power adapter are included in the package.

EM core configurations
**********************

The FPGA board includes a SPI flash storage device pre-programmed with FPGA
images containing different configurations of DesignWare® ARC EM cores.

The FPGA image can be selected using the pins 1 and 2 of the SW1 switch on the
board:

The following tables provide the details of supported EM Core configurations
for different suported versions of EMSK board.

Peripherals
***********

There are many peripheral devices available, such as SPI master, SPI slave,
IIC, UART, GPIO. External hardware interface devices can be connected to the
EMSK using Pmod Connectors. The Pmod connectors are controlled by Pmod mux
controller.

The peripheral memory mapping depends on the AHB address width. The
configuration *ARC_EM4_16CR* uses an address width of 24 bits. The other
configurations use an address width of 32 bits. The peripheral connections and
memory mappings for different supported versions of EMSK board are shown below:

**********************

Peripherals can generate interrupts to the CPU. The interrupt irq assignments
are as follows.

Programming and Debugging
-------------------------

Required Hardware and Software
******************************

To use embARC OSP applications on the IoTDK board, the following items are required

* USB Cable
* The USB cable provides power to the board (maximum 500 mA). However, if the board is to run
  standalone, the universal switching power adaptor (110-240V AC to 5V DC),
  can be used to power the board
* :ref:`software_requirement`.
* (optional) A collection of PMOD modules.

Set up the EMSK
***************

#. The EMSK has a bank of DIP switches labeled SW1 that are used to select a configuration. For example, to select ARC EM11D for EMSK 2.3, set bit 2 to the ON position (down), and the others to OFF (up) as shown.

.. figure:: /pic/images/getting_started/emsk23_dipswitch.jpg
   :scale: 40 %

   DIP switch settings for ARC EM11D on EMSK 2.3

For exact DIP switch settings for various ARC EM Starter Kit versions, refer to EM Starter Kit section in provided embARC documentation. For complete ARC EM Starter Kit information, see the **EM Starter Kit User's Guide** provided with the ARC EM Starter Kit.

#. Connect the USB cable to connector J7 on the EMSK to USB port on your development host. If using the Ashling Opella-XD for ARC Debug Probe, connect it to the J15 connector on EMSK.

.. note:: Despite the fact that EMSK 2.3 can be powered by connector J7, it is recommended to always use an AC adapter to supply power of the board.

#. You can use any terminal emulation program to view UART output from the EMSK. The USB connection provides both the debug channel and RS232 transport. Use PuTTY application on Windows as an example.

   * Determine which COM port the EMSK is using.

      * Open the **Windows Control Panel** and select **Device Manager** in a Windows environment.
      * Expand **Ports (COM and LPT)** in the list. Select **USB Serial Port (COM x)** and note the COM port number for the ARC board.

   * Configure serial terminal connection.

      * Launch PuTTY. Select **Serial** under **Connection type** and enter the appropriate COM port string under **Serial line**.
      * Choose 115200 baud, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity (115200-8-N-1) in settings.
      * You can optionally save your settings so they can be easily retrieved every time PuTTY is launched.
      * Click Open to open the console.

#. Test serial output with EMSK.

      * Press the middle ("R"eset) button above the **ARC** label on the EMSK board to reset the board and run the self-test.
      * Use EMSK 2.3 as an example. Confirm that you can see the header and self-test message printed to the console.

Building
********

Take :ref:`example_blinky` as an example and use the em7d configuration of EMSK 2.2

.. code-block:: console

   cd embarc_osp\example\baremetal\blinky
   # for ARC GNU toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=gnu BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d
   # for MWDT toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=mw  BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d

Running
*******

.. code-block:: console

   cd embarc_osp\example\baremetal\blinky
   # for ARC GNU toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=gnu  BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d
   # for MWDT toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=mw  BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d

Debugging
*********

.. code-block:: console

   cd embarc_osp\example\baremetal\blinky
   # for ARC GNU toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=gnu  BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d
   # for MWDT toolchain
   make TOOLCHAIN=mw  BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d

Flashing
********

EMSK has an on board SPI flash, but you cannot directly flash your
application into EMSK through debugger. You need other tools/applications
(e.g., embarc bootloader) to do this. Please refer :ref:`example_bootloader`
