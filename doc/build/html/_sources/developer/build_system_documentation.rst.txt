Overview
########

The embARC build system is based on the makefile system as shown below. To add new components, add a new makefile to the system. All embARC components are compiled into libraries,
which are then merged into one final library called **libembarc.a**. The application objects are then linked against **libembarc.a** to produce the target .elf file.

   embARC build system

The **options** directory under the embARC root folder contains the common makefiles as shown below.

* :file:`debug.mk`: target debug options for the MetaWare debugger, which supports Ashling OpellaXD and Digilent USB-JTAG connections.
* :file:`files.mk`: files and directory collections in embARC.
* :file:`options.mk`: entry makefile with common definitions, path definitions, other makefiles, and so on.
* :file:`rule.mk`: make targets and rules.
* :file:`scripts.mk`: common makefile functions
* :file:`toolchain.mk`: general toolchain definitions, including **toolchain_gnu.mk** for the ARC GNU toolchain and **toolchain_mw.mk** for the MetaWare toolchain.
* :file:`toolchain_gnu.mk` & :file:`toolchain_mw.mk`: toolchain specific compile and link options

Make Targets
############

embARC build system is based on make. It can be used for both the MetaWare and ARC GNU toolchains, Windows and Linux development hosts, and multiple ARC cores and boards.

There are several targets to make and run embARC examples on the command line. These make targets are defined in *options/rules.mk*. All the commands below use the default make options
provided in the embARC application makefile.

* **make help**: Show help document about how to use make in embARC.
* **make all**: Compile and link the target program.
* **make build**: Clean current configuration object files and rebuild configuration.
* **make run**: Compile and link the target program. For the MetaWare toolchain, call the MetaWare debugger (MDB) to load the target program to ARC board. For the ARC GNU toolchain, call arc-elf32-gdb and OpenOCD to load the target program to ARC board.
* **make gui**: Compile and link the target program. Launch the MetaWare debugger (MDB) in GUI mode for the MetaWare toolchain or arc-elf32-gdb in command-line mode for the ARC GNU toolchain to debug the target program.
* **make clean**: Clean object files for current build configuration.
* **make boardclean**: Clean all object files for currently selected board.
* **make distclean**: Clean all object files for different configurations.
* **make cfg**: Print current configurations of embARC.
* **make opt**: Print detailed configuration properties of embARC.

.. note:: If running *<embARC>/example/baremetal/bootloader* with **make run** in the command line, the default make options are enabled in the embARC application makefile. Run **make cfg** to see the configuration for this application.

Make Options
############

The make options are defined for embARC flexibility. They can be set through make command or hard-coded in the application makefile.

Options to Set Using Make Command
----------------------------------

Most options are located in *<embARC>/options/options.mk*. If you change an option value in *<embARC>/options/options.mk*, it will affect all the applications. You can set the value of the options in your own application makefile for the specified hardware.

* **BOARD**: Select the target board. The default value of this option is defined in *board/board.mk*. Optional values as below, default value is emsk. For example, ``make BOARD=emsk`` selects the EMSK board as the target board.

* **APPL_LIBS**: Set extra required application libraries to be linked. This option should be defined in your application makefile.

        * This **APP_LIBS** option collects extra linker option to include extra libraries to be linked.
        * For example, **APPL_LIBS = -lm** means linking math library to target program. **-lm** only support the ARC GNU toolchain.

* **HEAPSZ**: Set application heap size in bytes. This option should be defined in your application makefile. The default value of this option is **8192** defined in *<embARC>/options/options.mk*. It means the heap size of the application is set to 8192 bytes by default.

        * **HEAPSZ** is useful for baremetal applications. For FreeRTOS applications, you can define the RTOS heap size by setting **configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE** in *FreeRTOSConfig.h*.

* **STACKSZ**: Set application stack size in bytes. This option should be defined in your application makefile. The default value of this option is **8192** defined in *<embARC>/options/options.mk*. It means the stack size of the application is set to 8192 bytes as default.

        * For baremetal and Contiki applications, **STACKSZ** is useful for baremetal applications. For FreeRTOS applications, you can define the minimum RTOS task stack size by setting **configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE** in *FreeRTOSConfig.h*, and define each task's stack size in the application source code.

* **USE_BOARD_MAIN**: Control which board init process is used. The default value of this option is **1** defined in *<embARC>/board/board.mk*.

        * When **USE_BOARD_MAIN** is 0, it uses the normal board init process, compatible with previous embARC releases; you must do board_init yourself.
        * When **USE_BOARD_MAIN** is 1, embARC initializes fatfs, ntshell, and lwip with WiFi and creates a FreeRTOS task for main(). You can write applications or create new tasks in the main() function. When ntshell is enabled, the main() function needs to be triggered by the ntshell main command.

.. note:: For more details about how this new process is implemented, see <embARC>/board/board.c. In most embARC examples, you don't need to change **USE_BOARD_MAIN** to 0.

* **EXT_DEV_LIST**: Select peripheral device drivers used in your application.

        * Use **EXT_DEV_LIST** in the example's makefile. If more than one peripheral device drivers are selected, please use space between each other, like **EXT_DEV_LIST += EXT_DEV_LIST += wifi/mrf24g sensor/temperature/adt7420**.
        * Optional values for **EXT_DEV_LIST** can be found in *<embARC>/device/peripheral*. Select the target peripheral device drivers relative path, and add it to **EXT_DEV_LIST**.
        * Some onboard peripheral device drivers are already selected according to the target board, you can check it in the target board makefile, such as *<embARC>/board/emsk/emsk.mk*.

.. note:: WIFI_SEL is not available now. If choosing different WiFi, you need to change the EXT_DEV_LIST in your example makefile.

* **EMBARC_ROOT**: Set embARC source-code root directory path. This option should be defined in your application makefile to specify the path of the embARC source-code root. The path can be relative or absolute.

**Application related Options**

* **APPL**: Set embARC application name. **APPL** should be defined in your application makefile.
* **APPL_CSRC_DIR**: Set the path of application C source-code directories. **APPL_CSRC_DIR** should be defined in your application makefile.

        * All C source-code directory paths including subfolders should be added.
        * C source-code files should be suffixed with c or C, such as .c or .C.
        * The paths are separated by whitespace.

* **APPL_ASMSRC_DIR**: Set the path of application assembly source-code directories. **APPL_ASMSRC_DIR** should be defined in your application makefile.

        * All Assembly source-code directory paths including subfolders should be added.
