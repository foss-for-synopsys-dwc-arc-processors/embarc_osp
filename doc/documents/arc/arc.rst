Overview
########

The ARC **Hardware Abstraction Layer** (HAL) provides hardware abstraction for
|arc|. In this layer, the following functions are provided:

- :ref:`Start up <arc_hal_start>`: common startup routines or templates to handle necessary
  initializations after power on, reset, and so on.

- :ref:`Exception and interrupt management <arc_hal_exc_int>`: a standard exception and interrupt
  processing model and related resource definitions.

- :ref:`Unified intrinsic/built-in functions <arc_hal_builtin>`: covering both the MetaWare and GNU
  toolchains.

- :ref:`Unified resource definitions <arc_hal_res_def>`: registers, data types, macros, and so on.

- :ref:`Access to the resources <arc_hal_res_access>`: internal timers, cache, auxiliary registers,
  and build configuration registers.

Start up in embARC OSP
######################

The start up in embARC OSP can be divided into two parts:

Processor level start up
::::::::::::::::::::::::

The processor level start up process is implemented in ``arc_startup.s``. The
program jumps to the ``board_main()`` function after the startup process,
which runs in three stages:

.. image:: /pic/startup.jpg
    :alt: processor-level start up

- Stage 1: Hardware Initialization

  * Initialize necessayr status and registers.
  * Initialize system clock (if necessary, in user defined ``hardware_init_hook``).
  * Initialize memory controller (if necessary, in user defined ``hardware_init_hook``).

- Stage 2: C Run-time Initialization

  * Initialize the stack.
  * Copy section, e.g. data section, text section if necessary.
  * Clear Block Started by Symbol (BSS) section.

- Stage 3: Go to ``board_main()``

  * Early initialization of software (if necessary, in user defined ``software_init_hook``).
  * Call arc_exc_init, or other initialization functions.
  * Jump to ``board_main()`` function.

Board level start up
::::::::::::::::::::

The board level start up process is implemented ``board.c`` with an entry of ``board_main``.

The following pre-defined work is done in ``board_main`` function:

* board-level hardware initialization in ``board_init``

* Middleware initialization

  * initialize the ``xprintf`` function to have a console output
  * initialize the FatFs and mount the sd card if ``MID_FATFS`` is enabled
  * initialize NT-Shel if ``MID_NTSHELL`` is enabled

* OS specific initialization if ``ENABLE_OS`` is defined

  * create main task for user ``main`` function
  * create WiFi task if ``MID_LWIP`` is enabled and WiFi module is used

* jump to ``main`` function.

.. Note:: User can undefine the macro ``EMBARC_USE_BOARD_MAIN`` to bypass the pre-defined board-level initialization and do customized initialization.

Exceptions and Interrupts Management
####################################

ARC exceptions and interrupts
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

|arc| are designed to allow exceptions to be taken and handled by
interrupt service routines in user or kernel mode. All exceptions and
interrupts cause an immediate switch into kernel mode. Interrupts are disabled
on entry to an exception handler.

Exceptions can be divided into two types: CPU exceptions and interrupt
exceptions. CPU exceptions are triggered by errors such as illegal
instructions, invalid or illegal memory accesses, and protection violations.
Most CPU exceptions are synchronous. Interrupt exceptions are triggered by
device interrupts and are always asynchronous.

Exception vectors are fetched in the instruction space (``ICCM or main memory,
but not DCCM``) with an alignment 1024 bytes. Every exception contains the
following information:

* Vector Name is a symbolic equivalent of the vector number.

* Vector Number is a unique eight-bit index in the exception or interrupt
  vector table. Vector Offset is an offset value calculated as four times the
  vector number (vector offset = 4*vector_number), which is used to determine
  the position of the appropriate exception or interrupt service routine.

* Cause Code is an eight-bit number to identify the exact cause of an exception.

* Parameter is an eight-bit field to pass a single parameter from the exception
  to the exception handler and identify exceptions with the same cause code.

For more details, see the ``ARCv2 ISA Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM)``.

Exception and interrupt processing framework
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A basic exception and interrupt processing framework is implemented in embARC OSP.
Through this framework, you can handle specific exceptions or interrupts by
installing the desired handlers. This can help you analyze the underlying
details of saving and operating registers.

For CPU exceptions and interrupts, entry(``exc_entry_cpu`` for CPU exception, ``exc_entry_int`` for interrupts) is called first, then handler is
called in entry. You can define your own entry using ``exc_entry_install``.

A standard interrupt processing model is shown in the picture below.

.. image:: /pic/interrupt.jpg
    :alt: interrupt and exception processing


In this model, interrupts have the following features:

* Devices request interrupts through their own interrupt vectors and they can
  share the same interrupt vectors.

* An interrupt can be level-sensitive or pulse-sensitive.

* An interrupt can be enabled (unmasked) and disabled (masked).

* The priority of each interrupt can be programmed by software.

* Interrupt priority order is from INT_PRI_HIGH (highest, -1 default) to
  INT_PRI_MIN (lowest, -2 default).

* CPU lock and unlock are used to disable and enable interrupt processing.

For most Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), the task/process/thread priority
is a positive number and starts from 1 (the highest priority).

Negative numbers are used to define a unified priority scheme in embARC.
Priority 0 (highest priority) is always assigned to the OS scheduler. A
higher-priority task can preempt a lower-priority task. The OS scheduler can
preempt any other tasks. But interrupt handling tasks with negative numbers
cannot be scheduled or switched by the OS scheduler.

See ``arc_exception.h`` for further details.

.. _arc_hal_builtin:

Built-In Functions
##################

Compiler built-in functions are used to invoke certain processor operations
without writing assembly code. In embARC OSP, a series of built-in functions are
provided for both the MetaWare and GNU toolchains.

See ``arc_builtin.h`` for further details.

.. _arc_hal_res_def:

Resource Definitions
####################

The structure of resource definitions is
architecture->series->processor->board.

``arc.h`` includes the common resource definitions for the |arc|,
such as macros for exceptions and auxiliary register access.

``arc_em.h`` includes the common resource definitions for ARC EM Processors.

.. _arc_hal_res_access:

Access to Resources
###################

Internal timers
:::::::::::::::

|arc| have two independent 32-bit timers and a 64-bit real-time
counter (RTC). Timer 0 and Timer 1 are identical in operation. The only
difference is that these timers are connected to different interrupts. Each
timer is optional with a fixed interrupt: interrupt 16 for timer 0 and
interrupt 17 for timer 1.

The internal timers are connected to a system clock signal that always runs
even when the ARC EM processor is in the SLEEP state. The timers can be used
to generate interrupt signals that wake the processor from the SLEEP state.
The processor timers automatically reset and restart after reaching the limit
value. The processor timers can be programmed to count the clock cycles only
if the processor is not halted. The processor timers can also be programmed to
generate an interrupt or a system reset if they reach the limit value. The
64-bit RTC cannot generate any interrupts. This timer is used to count the
clock cycles automatically.

embARC OSP provides interfaces for internal timers such as start, stop, poll, and read.

See ``arc_timer.h`` for further details

Caches
::::::

|arc| can be configured with both data cache (dcache) and
instruction cache (icache). The cache configuration can be selected as
desired. The cache can be controlled through specific auxiliary registers.

embARC provides unified interfaces to enable/disable, flush, invalidate, lock,
and unlock cache lines and to access cache-internal RAM.

See ``arc_cache.h`` for further details.

uDMA
::::

The DMA controller is an optional high performance, low area/energy
consumption DMA engine for use in the ARC EM 2.0 cores.

The DMA controller supports the following features:

* 1 to 16 independent programmable DMA channels (number of channels is configurable)
* User-programmable prioritization scheme for all available channels
* Concurrent operation with the CPU
* Software/Hardwareâ€“triggered DMA transfers
* Two addressing modes
* Five data transfer modes (configurable down to one)
* Internal and external interrupt support

MPU
:::

The ARCv2-based Memory Protection Unit (MPU) provides protection by dividing
the address space into regions associated with specific attributes such as
Read, Write, and Execute. If an attempt is made to access a region for which
an associated attribute is not permitted, the ARCv2-based processors raises a
Protection Violation exception, and this exception prevents the faulting
instruction from completing.

See ``arc_mpu.h`` for further details
