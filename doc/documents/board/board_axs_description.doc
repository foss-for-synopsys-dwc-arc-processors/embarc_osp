\section sect_bdaxs_description ARC Software Development Platform
The ARC Software Development Platform is a powerful, high-speed development platform,
enabling real-time software development and validation, code porting, software debugging,
and system analysis. Readily available DesignWare IP has been used to build the ARC
Software Development Platform, which is thus well-suited for SoC prototyping including
ARC CPUs.

\section sect_bdaxs_usage How to Run in embARC
For example, first follow the documentation of AXS 103, select the core to be HS36, and then go to axs103 example folder <b>example/baremetal/arc_feature/axs103</b>, this example will do basic AXS 103 board tests including leds, buttons.
To run this example, just type **gmake BOARD=axs BD_VER=103 CUR_CORE=archs36 run**
