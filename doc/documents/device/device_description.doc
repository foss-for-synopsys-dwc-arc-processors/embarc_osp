\section sect_device_introduction Introduction

The device folder in the root of embARC contains the necessary software APIs and implementations for common device IP. The device layer consists of the following components:
- <b>Device HAL</b>: a device hardware abstraction layer including WNIC (Wireless Network Interface Controller), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), IIC (Inter-Integrated Circuit), GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) and SDIO (Secure Digital Input and Output).
- <b>Implementation</b>: device driver implementations based on the above device HAL, including WNIC implementation of Microchip MRF24G WiFi device and DesignWare IP implementations of UART, IIC, SPI, GPIO and SDIO devices.

\section sect_device_devicehal Device HAL

The Device HAL provides abstraction for the following devices:
- <b>GPIO</b>: GPIO device abstraction in dev_gpio.h
- <b>I2C</b>: I2C device abstraction in dev_iic.h
- <b>SPI</b>: SPI device abstraction in dev_spi.h
- <b>UART</b>: UART device abstraction in dev_uart.h
- <b>SDIO</b>: SDIO device abstraction in dev_sdio.h
- <b>WNIC</b>: WINC device abstraction in dev_wnic.h


These *.h files provide abstraction APIs and macros that require corresponding implementations. embARC provides the device implementations in <b>device/ip/designware</b>, <b>device/peripheral</b>, and <b>board/xxxx/drivers</b>.  \n
Different device features are abstracted in the device HAL, such as UART, IIC, and SPI. Object-oriented concepts are adopted to provide common device operation APIs and device access APIs. See the section for each device for detailed information of the device HAL.

\section sect_device_implemented_drivers_in_embARC Device Drivers in embARC Software Package

The files relevant to supported devices in the <b>embARC Software Package</b> are described in the table below:

|      Source Code Folder             |                    Comments                           |
| :---------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|  board/xxxx/drivers                 |    Peripheral driver implementations for devices on board xxxx|
|  device/ip/designware/xxxx             |    Device HAL implementation for DesignWare IP, e.g. GPIO, I2C, SPI |
|  device/ip/ip_hal/inc              |    Device HAL definitions       |
|  device/peripheral/xxx             |    Peripheral drivers implementation, e.g. pmod modules, WiFi, BLE |

See also \ref DEVICE_HAL "Device HAL API"

- \ref DEVICE_HAL_COMMON
- \ref DEVICE_HAL_IIC
- \ref DEVICE_HAL_SPI
- \ref DEVICE_HAL_GPIO
- \ref DEVICE_HAL_UART
- \ref DEVICE_HAL_WNIC

\note The DesignWare UART, IIC, and SPI drivers support both polling mode and interrupt mode. SDIO driver only supports polling mode

\section sect_device_use_dev  How use to on-chip device IP and peripherals
To use on-chip device ip and peripherals, two new variables are introduced in build system, ONCHIP_IP_LIST and EXT_DEV_LIST.

For most cases, when a board/SoC/chip is determined, its on-chip IP is also determined, ONCHIP_IP_LIST is mainly defined in board's makefile. Taking EMSK as an example, it has Designware SPI/IIC/GPIO/UART, so <b>ONCHIP_IP_LIST ?= designware/iic designware/spi designware/uart designware/gpio </b> is added.

Different applications may use difference peripherals. Therefore, EXT_DEV_LIST is always defined in application level. For example, WiFi based applications will use pmod WiFi module, then in its application makefile, <b>EXT_DEV_LIST += wifi/mrf24g</b> is defined to use the pmod WiFi module.

\section sect_device_add_new_devce_to_embARC Adding New Device to embARC
\subsection sect_device_add_ip Add on-chip IP
If the HAL of the new device is defined, follow the steps below:
- Create a subfolder under the device/ip folder.
- Implement the driver according to the device HAL definition and existing DesignWare IP implementations.
- Add corresponding makefile.

If the HAL of the new device is not defined, follow the steps below:
- Create a header file under <b>device/ip/ip_hal</b>.
- Add the HAL definition for the new device.
- Implement the driver according to the device HAL definition.
- Add corresponding makefile.

\subsection sect_device_add_periphreal Add on-board or external peripherals

- Add the driver in <b>device/peripheral</b> folder according to the class of peripheral. For example, a flash device xxx should be in the folder <b>device/peripheral/flash/xxx</b> folder.
- Add corresponding makefile.
