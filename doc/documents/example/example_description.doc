\subsection sect_example_how_to_use_embARC_usage_notice Prerequisites Before Using embARC

Before working with embARC, review the following prerequisites:
- Make sure to check whether the path of \ref EMBARC_DEVELOPMENT_REQUIREMENT "All the Required Tools(updated)" for the MetaWare and ARC GNU tool chains is added to the system variable **PATH** in your environment variables.
- Download extra third-party source code and apply embARC patches; for details see \ref EMBARC_APPLY_PATCHES "Download Extra Source Code and Apply Required Patches".
- Use **gmake** with the MetaWare toolchain and **make** with the ARC GNU toolchain.
- The embARC software build system is purely makefile-based. Developers need to provide makefiles for new embARC applications. The makefile template can be found at <b><embARC>/example/example.makefile</b>.
- Go to \ref page_example_usage "Example Usage Guide" for more details.
\anchor      EMBARC_ARCGNU_OPENOCD_PATHSET
- Using the ARC GNU toolchain
  - If running and debugging embARC applications using arc-elf32-gdb and OpenOCD, check whether the path of openocd is added to the **PATH** in your environment variables and modify the **OPENOCD_SCRIPT_ROOT** variable in <b><embARC>/options/toolchain/toolchain_gnu.mk</b> according to your OpenOCD root path.
  - If running GNU program with using the GNU toolchain on Linux, modify the OpenOCD configuration file as Linux format with LF line terminators. **dos2unix** can be used to convert it.
  - If using the embARC pre-installed GNU IDE projects on Windows, installing the GNU IDE in the default location is recommended. If using the embARC pre-installed GNU IDE projects on Linux, or installing the GNU IDE in non-default locations on Windows, it is necessary to change the OpenOCD executable path and OpenOCD configuration file path in the tab of <b>Debugger->Gdbserver Settings</b> manually for the debug configuration.
- Using Ashling Opella-XD debugger
  - If you want to use Ashling Opella-XD debugger, you need to set **JTAG** to *opella*, and check where the driver for this JTAG located.
  - You need to check and change all the **ASH_PATH** defined in <b>options/scripts.mk</b> according to where you install the driver to and the OS environment you use.
  - Only supported by Metaware.

\note See \ref EMBARC_KNOWN_ISSUES "FAQS" and check [embARC website](https://embarc.org/) and [embARC Forum](https://forums.embarc.org/) for the latest information on known issues. If you find any issues to report, post a new discussion item in [embARC Forum](https://forums.embarc.org/).
\note <b><embARC></b> represents the location where you put the embARC source code, such as **C:/embARC**.

\subsection sect_example_how_to_use_embARC_targets_in_make Make Targets for embARC

There are several targets to make and run embARC examples on the command line. These make targets are defined in <b>options/rules.mk</b>, and an overview is provided below. All the commands below use the default make options provided in the embARC application makefile.

- <b>make help</b>: Show help document about how to use make in embARC.
- <b>make all</b>: Compile and link the target program.
- <b>make build</b>: Clean current configuration object files and rebuild configuration.
- <b>make run</b>: Compile and link the target program. For the MetaWare toolchain, call the MetaWare debugger (mdb) to load the target program onto EMSK. For the ARC GNU toolchain, call arc-elf32-gdb and OpenOCD to load the target program onto EMSK.
- <b>make gui</b>: Compile and link the target program. Launch the MetaWare debugger (MDB) in GUI mode for the MetaWare toolchain or arc-elf32-gdb in command-line mode for the ARC GNU toolchain to debug the target program.
- <b>make clean</b>: Clean object files for current build configuration.
- <b>make boardclean</b>: Clean all object files for currently selected board.
- <b>make distclean</b>: Clean all object files for different configurations.
- <b>make cfg</b>: Print current configurations of embARC.

See \ref sect_example_usage_GeneralBuildSteps for more details.

\note For example, if you are running <b><embARC>/example/baremetal/bootloader</b> with <b>make run</b> command on the command line, the default \ref sect_example_how_to_use_embARC_make_options "Make Options" are enabled in the embARC application makefile. Run the <b>make cfg</b> command to see the default configuration for this application.

\subsection sect_example_how_to_use_embARC_make_options Make Options for embARC

- The make options are defined for using embARC flexibly. They can be set through make command or hard-coded in the application makefile.
- Most options are located in <b><embARC>/options/options.mk</b>. If you change an option value in <b><embARC>/options/options.mk</b>, it will affect all the applications to some extent. You can set the value of the options in your own application makefile for the specified application.

\note It is better to set <b>BOARD</b>, <b>BD_VER</b>, <b>CUR_CORE</b>, and <b>TOOLCHAIN</b> in the make command, such as *make BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d TOOLCHAIN=gnu*. It is better to hard-code other make options in the application makefile.
