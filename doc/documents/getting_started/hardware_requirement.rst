   EMSK board connections

All versions of EMSK have the same board connections.

.. note:: The above connections are set as default in the embARC OSP. You can set your board connections in *<embARC>/board*. The hardware may be damaged by wrong connections.

Setting Board Environment
##########################
* Set serial terminal

  * The default UART baudrate is 115200 bps.
  * For example, in the Tera Term menu, select **Setup -> Serial Port** and change the settings for port and baudrate.

* If using WiFi modules in the embARC OSP, a WiFi hotspot with **WPA/WPA2 PSK** encrypted is necessary. Some changes in *<embARC>/board* should be made before running embARC examples.

  * Check the *<embARC>/board/board.h*. And go to the target board header file, For example, go to *<embARC>/board/emsk/emsk.h* for EMSK.
  * Set the WiFi hotspot name to **embARC**.
  * Set the WiFi hotspot IP address range from **192.168.43.1** to **192.168.43.254**.
  * Set the WiFi password to **qazwsxedc**.

If the WiFi hotspot IP address settings cannot be changed, the settings in the board setting header file must be modified.

  #define WF_HOTSPOT_PASSWD             "qazwsxedc"

The IP address settings should be adjusted according to your hotspot settings.
  * For example, if your hotspot IP address is 192.168.1.1, your WiFi hotspot name is "myhotspot", and password is "12345678", change the settings as shown below. Make sure the IP address (WF_IPADDR_x) doesn't conflict with other WiFi devices in the same network.

    #define WF_NETMASK_3                  (255)

    #define WF_HOTSPOT_NAME               "myhotspot"
    #define WF_HOTSPOT_PASSWD             "12345678"

.. note:: If the hotspot IP address range is not similar to **192.168.43.xxx**, the IP address settings of the EMSK board should be changed in the target board header file. The baremetal examples don't support DHCP. A static IP address is required.
