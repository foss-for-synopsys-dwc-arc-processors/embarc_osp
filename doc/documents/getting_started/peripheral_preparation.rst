Peripheral Preparation
======================

This is a quick manual helping you to connect your peripheral modules with your embARC boards.

MUX Controller Setting
######################
On most of embARC boards, pins are multiplexed for various usages: uart, i2c, spi, etc. One pin can not be accessed by different usage simultaneously, that's where MUX controller comes in.
We will take PMOD interface as example to explain the setting method. Other interfaces (Andruino, MikroBUS, etc.) can take PMOD as reference, and use the same method for setting.

1. You need to find mux controller code at ``embarc_osp/board/[board_type]/drivers/mux``.
[board_type] should be replaced to board type name, such as *emsk*, *hsdk* or *iotdk*.

2. If you are using EMSK, go to mux.c and find ``io_mux_init()`` function, you will see it calls ``set_pmod_mux()`` with MUX options as parameters.
MUX options are defined in mux.h and you can change them as you see fit.

For example, you want to connect your EMSK with two i2c sensor modules. By default setting you only have PM2 as i2c interface.
So now you have to check mux.h or EMSK manual to see if it support one more i2c interface.
Notice that there is a ``PM3_I2C_GPIO_D`` macro in mux.h meaning that PM3 support i2c interface. Now all you need to do is to replace the default PM3 setting in ``set_pmod_mux()`` to ``PM3_I2C_GPIO_D``.
Now your code should be like this:

.. code-block:: c

	set_pmod_mux(PM1_UR_UART_0 | PM1_LR_SPI_S	\
				| PM2_I2C_HRI		\
				| PM3_I2C_GPIO_D	\
				| PM4_I2C_GPIO_D	\
				| PM5_UR_SPI_M1 | PM5_LR_GPIO_A	\
				| PM6_UR_SPI_M0 | PM6_LR_GPIO_A );

.. note:: Notice that **UR** means Upper Layer of Pmod interface and **LR** means Lower Layer of Pmod

3. If you are using HSDK, go to mux.c and find ``io_mux_init()`` function, you will find it calls ``creg_hsdc_set_gpio_mux()`` with parameter array ``gpio_mux_config`` as MUX options.
By default all pins are set to GPIO, other MUX options are defined in ``PINMUX_TYPE`` in ``embarc_osp/device/inc/dev_pinmux.h``

4. If you are using IoTDK, go to mux.c and find ``int32_t  io_pmod_config(uint32_t pmod, uint32_t type, uint32_t config)`` function.
All three parameters should use definitions in ``embarc_osp/device/inc/dev_pinmux.h``.

	* The first paramater can be choose from ``PMOD_PORT`` (e.g. *PMOD_A*, *PMOD_B*, *PMOD_C*), other inputs will be ignored.
	* The second parameter should be in ``PMOD_TYPE``, unsupported options will have no effect.
	* The third parameter should be ``IO_PINMUX_ENABLE`` or ``IO_PINMUX_DISABLE``, enabling or disabling the mux controller respectively.

5. If you are using EMSDP, go to mux.c and find ``io_mux_init()`` function, you will find it calls ``set_pmod_mux()`` with MUX options as parameters.
MUX options are defined in mux.h and you can change them as you see fit.

.. note:: In EMSDP, notice that **CFG0** means Upper Layer of Pmod interface and **CFG1** means Lower Layer of Pmod

PMOD Modules
############

PMOD WiFi Modules
******************
`Pmod WiFi <https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodwifi/start>`_ : Primary IC type is MRF24WG, use **SPI** and a few **GPIO** pins for data changing and controlling.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/wifi/mrf24g``.

RW009 WiFi : This type of module also uses **SPI** and **GPIO** pins for data changing and controlling.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/wifi/rw009``.


PMOD Temperature Module
***********************
`Pmod TMP2 <https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodtmp2/start>`_ : Sensor chip type is ADT7420, use **I2C** for data collection.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/sensor/temperature/adt7420``.

`Pmod TMP3 <https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodtmp3/start>`_ : Sensor chip type is TCN75A, use **I2C** for data collection.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/sensor/temperature/tcn75``.

Other PMOD or Compatible Modules
********************************
`Pmod AD2 <https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodad2/start>`_ : ADC type is AD7991, use **I2C** for data collection.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/adc/ad7991``.

`ESP01\/ESP01S <https://wiki.ai-thinker.com/esp8266/docs>`_ : Primary IC type is ESP8266, use **UART** interface for data changing and controlling.
Driver code at ``embarc_osp/device/peripheral/wifi/slip_esp``.

The ESP01/ESP01S module is not originally a PMOD module, however it is PMOD compatible, meaning that you can wire it to PMOD interface on board. You need to connect GND(embARC) to GND(ESP) , 3.3V(embARC) to VCC(ESP), RXD(embARC) to TXD(ESP), and TXD(embARC) to RXD(ESP), respectively. Please take reference from datasheet of `ESP01\/ESP01S <https://wiki.ai-thinker.com/esp8266/docs>`_ and UART (type 4A) part of `Digilent Pmod Spec <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_ for pin layout.
