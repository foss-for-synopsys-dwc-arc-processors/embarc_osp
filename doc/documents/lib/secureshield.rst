SecureShiled
############

SecureShield enables the execution of applications in isolated, Trusted
Execution Environments (TEE). Multiple, isolated environments can run on a
single core. The SecureShield runtime is a microvisor implementation that
provides the required isolation, enforced by processor privilege levels and
the memory-protection unit (MPU). Depending on the level of trust for the
application, each execution environment can be given or denied access to
system resources like memory, memory-mapped I/O, CPU control registers, and
APEX extension instructions and registers.

Terminology
===========

SecureShield Runtime
--------------------

SecurrShield runtime is a kind of microvisor implementation for ARC EM
Processors with MPU to manage containers, analogous to RTOS kernel managing
tasks.

Container
---------

A container defines a sandbox for an application. The container provides the
trusted execution environment for application code runs in. Containers are
designed to be isolated from each other. Each container has its own space
attributes, including the stack area (required), context area (optional),
resources (peripherals, interrupt, auxiliary registers). A container context
is the memory area (ROM or RAM) that is used for the container itself; it is
defined in the container configuration.

Secure Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Secure containers have a secure privilege level, meaning that Secure
containers are trusted and can access all the resources in the system. Bugs or
malware in a secure container can compromise the system so a container that is
configured as secure can not be changed at runtime.

Normal Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normal containers have a normal privilege level, meaning that their access to
system resources is limited. Normal containers are only allowed to access the
resources allocated to them. If they attempt to access other resources, a
violation exception is raised.

Background Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The background container is a special normal container whose resources are
shared to all the other containers. It has no context area, and its stack is
the original application stack when SecureShield is not enabled.

Resources
---------

The core concept in SecureShield is that a container can only access resources
that have been explicitly allocated to it.

Memory Mapped Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The memory mapped resources are resources that are mapped into memory address
space, e.g. ram, rom, peripherals (UART/I2/SPI). Memory mapped resources are
isolated and protected by the MPU.

System Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System resources are resources that are not isolated and protected by MPU,
e.g., interrupts, exceptions, registers, APEX. System resources are isolated
and protected by the processor privilege level. Secure system resources
require secure privilege level and can be allocated to normal containers;
normal system resources require normal privilege level and are shared to all
containers.

System resources APIs are used by normal containers to access secure system
resources. Because secure containers have secure privilege level, then can
access secure system resources directly.

Container Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A container can provide services to other containers through an interface. An
interface is a C function with parameters and return value registered in an
access control table.

As shown below, a container can call the interface of
another container through container call. The container interface will be
executed in the context of callee container.

.. image:: /pic/secureshield_container_interface.jpg
    :alt: Container Interface

Background container has no interfaces as it is a global shared container,
i.e., regular C function calls can be performed.


Resources of a container
------------------------

A container has implicit resources: code sections (.text, .rodata, .bss,
.data) and stack; as well as explicit resources defined in an access control
table, e.g., memory mapped resources, system resources and container
interfaces.

Access Control Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The privileges that a container has to access the system are defined via
Access Control (AC).

Each container has a table that defines the allocated resources and privilege
level, including memory, interrupts, and peripherals. This table is referred
to as the access-control table or access-control list.

Each item in this table or list is called an access-control item. An access
control item has the type access control, and additional attributes that
constitute a triplet: {attribute1, attribute2, type|access}.

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct
    {
        void* param1;       /* address parameter or function pointer */
        uint32_t param2;    /* size or no. */
        CONTAINER_AC ac;    /* resource type, access control types */
    } EMBARC_PACKED CONTAINER_AC_ITEM;

An access-control table example is shown below:

.. code-block:: c

     static CONTAINER_AC_TABLE g_container_act[] = {
    	/* memory mapper peripheral, {start_address, size in bytes, type | access} */
        {(void *)(PERIPHERAL_ADDR_BASE + REL_REGBASE_PINMUX), 0x1000, SECURESHIELD_ACDEF_UPERIPH},
        /* memory, {start_address, size in bytes, type | access} */
    	{(void *)0x10000, 0x1000, SECURESHIELD_ACDEF_URAM},
    	/* system resources-interrupt, {interrupt handler, interrupt no, type} */
    	{default_interrupt_handler, INTNO_GPIO, SECURESHIELD_AC_IRQ},
    	/* system resources-auxiliary registers, {start_address, size, type}*/
    	{(void *)0x21, 0x3, SECURESHIELD_AC_AUX},
    	/* container interface, {interface handler, number of interface handler arguments, type} */
   	{tst_func4, 4, SECURESHIELD_AC_INTERFACE},
     };

According to this access control table, the container is allocated the
peripheral area of PIN_MUX, a 0x1000 bytes ram region starting from 0x10000, a
GPIO interrupt (INTNO_GPIO), an auxiliary-register area starting from 0x21
with a size of 03. The container also has an interface (tst_func4) to provide
the service with 4 arguments in the interface handler function

The resource type describes the kind of resource, such as interrupt, register,
or memory. The access-control attribute describes how it is accessed: secure
or normal, read/write/execute. The detailed definitions of resource type and
access-control attribute is listed as follow.

.. csv-table:: Container Resoure Type
    :file: container_resources_type.csv
    :header-rows: 1

.. csv-table:: Container Resoure Attribute
    :file: container_resources_attribute.csv
    :header-rows: 1

More details can be found in secureshield_vmpu_exports.h. For some resources, there are pre-defined CONTAINER_AC, e.g., SECURESHIELD_ACDEF_U/KROM, SECURESHIELD_ACDEF_U/KRAM.

Secure Call
-----------

In SecureShield, a secure call is implemented as a section of assembly code
and invoked as a normal function call. The secure call is the only
communication interface for a container to call the SecureShield runtime
services. The following SecureShield runtime services are provided:

- container call: call the services provided by other containers

- interrupt management: see secureshield_int_exports.h

- auxiliary-register access and benchmark function: see
  ``secureshield_sys_ops_exports.h``


.. image:: /pic/secureshield_secure_call.jpg
    :alt: Secure call

.. code-block:: c

    #define SECURESHIELD_SECURE_CALL(id, metadata, ...) \
        ({ \
            SECURESHIELD_MACRO_REGS_ARGS(uint32_t, ##__VA_ARGS__) \
            SECURESHIELD_MACRO_REGS_RETVAL(uint32_t, res) \
            Asm( \
                "SECURE_INSTN %[secure_call_id]\n" \
                metadata \
                : SECURESHIELD_MACRO_ASM_OUTPUT(res) \
                : SECURESHIELD_MACRO_ASM_INPUT(__VA_ARGS__), \
                [secure_call_id] "i" (id) \
            ); \
            res; \
        })

If SECURESHIELD_VERSION == 1, SECURE_INSTN is trap_s; If SECURESHIELD_VERSION
== 2, SECURE_INSTN is sjli.

Container Call
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although containers are isolated from each other, a container can provide
services to other containers through container interface. The container
interface must first be registered in the access control table. The background
container has no interface as its resources are shared to all other
containers.

To call a container interface, container all is required. The following is an
example.


.. code-block:: c

    int tst_func2(int arg1, int arg2)
    {
        return arg1+arg2;
    }

    static const CONTAINER_AC_ITEM g_container1_act[] = {
        {tst_func, 2, SECURESHIELD_AC_INTERFACE}
    };

In the above code, container1 has one interface named tst_func2 with two
arguments to provide services. If other containers want to call this service,
the following container call should be made:

.. code-block:: c

    ret = container_call(container1, tst_func2, 1, 2);

.. image:: /pic/secureshield_container_call.jpg
    :alt: Container call


The container_call will be expanded into the following assembly.

.. code-block:: c

        mov r0, 1
        mov r1, 2
        SECURE_INSTN SECURESHIELD_SECURE_CALL_CONTAINER_IN
        b skip_args1
        .long SECURESHIELD_CONTAINER_CALL_MAGIC
        .long tst_func2
        .long container1_cfg_prt

.. note::

    Container calls can be nested, i.e., in a container interface, another
    container call can be made. But the target container should not be the
    caller container, i.e.,  **a loop of container call is not allowed !**

    Also, container call is not allowed to be made in the interrupt and
    exception handler

    Because SecureShield runtime is not integrated with OS, in the container
    call which will cause container switch, task scheduler should be disabled
    to avoid task switch.

Memory Map
==========

The memory map of a SecureShield application is shown as follow. There are two
worlds, secure world and normal world. The normal world, consisting of normal
containers, is in normal memory (normal rom and ram). The secure world,
consisting of secure containers, is in secure memory (secure rom and ram). In
each world, containers are isolated with each other through MPU, an address
alignment is also required. Besides secure containers, SecureShield runtime,
can be viewed as a special secure container, is in secure memory with a fixed
position. SecureShiled runtime will be compiled and linked independently with
the application, so it's a black box to application.

Compile and Link Flow
=====================

Different with common one shot compile and link, there are two compiles and
links in SecureShiled application, one for SecureShield runtime, one for
application.

Phase1: SecureShield runtime compile and link
---------------------------------------------

The compile and link flow is shown as follow

.. image:: /pic/secureshield_1st_compile.jpg
    :alt: SecureShiled runtime compile and link

Phase2: Application compile and link
------------------------------------

The compile and link flow is shown as follow:

.. image:: /pic/secureshield_2nd_compile.jpg
    :alt: Application compile and link

Steps to Create a SecureShield Application
==========================================

1. makefiles

- LIB_SEL += secureshield, select SecureShield library

- -DLIB_SECURESHIELD_OVERRIDES, this definition will enable override mechanism
  which will override the ARC HAL API in arc_exception.h, arc_builtin.h and
  arc_exception.h with the secureshield API

- APPL_SECURE_CSRC_DIR (optional), the directories of C source files which
  need to be compiled and linked with SecureShield runtime

- SECURE_SYMBOL_LIST (optional ), the file of symbols need to be exported to
  normal application from secure binary

2. Container Memory Configuration File (secureshield_appl_config.h)

secureshield_appl_config.h includes the application information to generate
the correct memory map

- SECURE_REGION_CONTAINERS_ROM : the regions need to be generated in
  NORMAL_ROM

- SECURE_REGION_CONTAINERS_RAM : the regions need to be generated in
  NORMAL_RAM

- SECURE_REGION_CONTAINERS_SCURE_ROM : the regions need to be generated in
  SECURE_ROM  (secure containers only)

- SECURE_REGION_CONTAINERS_SECURE_RAM : the regions need to be generated in
  SECURE_RAM (secure containers only)


.. code-block:: c

    /* tell linker script template the rom region information of containers */
    #define SECURESHIELD_REGION_CONTAINERS_ROM \
                        GEN_CONTAINER_ROM_SECTION(container1, 2048, *container1.o*)

    /* tell linker script template the ram region information of containers */
    #define SECURESHIELD_REGION_CONTAINERS_RAM \
                        GEN_CONTAINER_RAM_SECTION(container1, 2048, *container1.o*)

The above code segment will generate the following sections in final linker
script if LIB_SECURESHIELD_VERSION=2

.. code-block:: c

    .rom.container1 ALIGN(128): {
        _f_text_container1 = .;
        *(.text.container1)
        "*container1.o*"(TYPE text)
        . = ALIGN(128);
        _e_text_container1 = .;
        _f_rodata_container1 = .;
        *(.rodata.container1)
        "*container1.o*"(TYPE lit)
        . = ALIGN(128);
        _e_rodata_container1 = .;
        } > NORMAL_ROM
    .ram.data.container1 ALIGN(128) : {
            _f_data_container1 = .;
             *(.data.container1)
              "*container1.o*"(TYPE data)
               _e_data_container1 = .;
        } > NORMAL_RAM AT > NORMAL_ROM
    .ram.bss.container1 : {
          _f_bss_container1 = .;
           *(.bss.container1)
            "*container1.o*"(TYPE BSS)
             . = ALIGN(128);
              _e_bss_container1 = .;
        } > NORMAL_RAM
        _f_data_load_container1 = LOADADDR(.ram.data.container1);

3. Container Access Control Configuration

The container access control configuration is recommended to be in a specific
file named container_cfg.c

4. Coding

A recommended SecureShield application is :

- one container, one source file or directory, e.g container1 in container1.c

- files compiled with SecureShield runtime are in specific directory, e.g. secure

5. Define the exported secure symbols

secure_symbol.txt contains the symbols (container interface) exported to normal application from secure binary. This file is only required when normal application needs to call the symbol in secure binary. It also needs to be defined in makefile.
For example, the following container (container4) will be compiled and linked with secure binary, it has two interfaces:

.. code-block:: c

    static CONTAINER_AC_TABLE g_container4_act[] = {
    {tst_func_sec1, 0, SECURESHIELD_AC_INTERFACE},
    {tst_func_sec2, 0, SECURESHIELD_AC_INTERFACE}
    };

Then the secure_symbol.txt should be:

.. code-block:: c

    tst_func_sec1
    tst_func_sec2

6. Compile and Debug

Upon compiling and linking, the following files will be generated:

- linker_xx.ldf: the generated linker script for normal application

- the generated linker script for secure binary

- secureshield_secure.bin/elf: secure binary

- secureshield_secure.syms: the exported secure symbol list
