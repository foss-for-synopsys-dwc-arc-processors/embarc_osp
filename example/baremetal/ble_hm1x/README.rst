BLE Module: HM1X
################

Overview
********

 This example is designed to demonstrate how to operate UART-based BLE device HM10 via UART and how to use HM-10 BLE API defined in hm1x.h.

Detailed Description
====================
 * Extra Required Tools
    BLE APP on SmartPhone:
        - Android: BLE Android ComAssistant
        - iOS: `LightBlue <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110>`_

 * Extra Required Peripherals
    UART Based BLE Device HM-10

 * Design Concept
    This example is designed to demonstrate how to operate UART-based BLE device HM10 via UART and how to use HM-10 BLE API defined in hm1x.h.

 * Usage Manual
    - How to connect HM-10 to "EMSK".
      Connect the Pmod HM-10 to J1.
    - How to use this example
        | This example demonstrates how to use the API of HM-10 located in *device/peripheral/ble*. The APIs contain methods to send AT command and receive response, and read or write data to BLE device.
        | The example performs tests on the HM-10 BLE device using different uart baudrate, which take approximately 2 minutes, then the device will enter to receive and send mode.
        | Users can use a BLE-UART APP on their smartphone which must support BLE, for android please use BLE Android ComAssistant, for iOS please use LightBlue.

 * Extra Comments
 	NO

	Try to reset the baudrate to 9600bps
	Do send and receive test under baudrate:9600bps
	Start HM1X-BLE Send Receive Test, please connect to HM1X-BLE using its app.
	The main loop will receive data from HM1X, and send back what it received.
