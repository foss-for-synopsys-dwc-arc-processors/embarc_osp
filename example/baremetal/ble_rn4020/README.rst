BLE Moude: iotdk onboard RN4020 module
######################################

Overview
********

 This example is designed to demonstrate how to operate UART-based BLE device RN4020 via UART and how to use RN4020 BLE API defined in rn4020.h.

Detailed Description
====================
 * Extra Required Tools
    BLE APP on SmartPhone:
        - Android: `nRF Connect <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en_US>`_
        - iOS: `LightBlue <http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110?mt=8>`_

 * Design Concept
    This example is designed to demonstrate how to operate UART-based BLE device RN4020 via UART and how to use RN4020 BLE API defined in rn4020.h.

 * Usage Manual
    - How to use this example
        | This example demonstrates how to use the API of RN4020 located in *device/peripheral/ble*. The APIs contain methods to send AT command and receive response, and read or write data to BLE device.
        | The example performs tests on the RN4020 BLE device using different uart baudrate, which take approximately 2 minutes, then the device will enter to receive and send mode.
        | Users can use a BLE-UART APP on their smartphone which must support BLE, for android please use nRF Connect, for iOS please use LightBlue.

 * Extra Comments
 	NO
