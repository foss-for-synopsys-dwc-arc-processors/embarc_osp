 * \brief	OpenThread Network Co-Processor (NCP) on MRF24J40
 *
 * \details
 * ### Extra Required Tools
 *
 * ### Extra Required Peripherals
 *     * 2 x EMSK
 *     * 2 x Digilent PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40)
 *     * 2 x SD card
 *
 * ### Design Concept
 *     This example is an OpenThread Network Co-Processor (NCP) application on PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40).
 *     This example can serve as a low-power wireless Network Co-Processor (NCP) to join Thread network
 *         and communicate with Userspace WPAN Network Daemon (wpantund) on Unix-like operating systems.
 *     This example can be used along with OpenThread wpantund to provide Internet connectivity to the Thread network.
 *         For more information about NCP and wpantund, see README.md for reference.
 *     The NCP status can not be shown on the terminal via UART, it might show messy code.
 *
 * ### Usage Manual
 *     - See \ref EMBARC_BOARD_CONNECTION "EMSK" to connect PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40).
 *
 *     - How to use this example
 *
 *       * Program the secondary bootloader application into onboard SPI flash of EMSKs.
 *       * Generate boot.bin of the Openthread NCP example using "make bin".
 *       * Run an Openthread CLI example first with boot.bin from SD card, see `cli\README.md` for more information.
 *         - Insert SD Card back to one EMSK. It will run the CLI example. Press the reset button to reboot it. Wait for loading boot.bin from SD card.
 *         - Enter “1” and press Enter button in the Tera Term. Enter the number here to generate pseudo random number for OpenThread.
 *         - Enter the following commands in the two terminal windows, "panid 0x1234", "ifconfig up", "thread start", to start
 *           Thread process.
 *         - Wait 20 seconds for completing Thread configuration. Enter “state” to see the state of the node, it will be the leader.
 *       * Run Openthread NCP example with boot.bin from SD card. Make sure Bit 4 of the onboard DIP switch is ON to enable
 *         the secondary bootloader.
 *         - Insert the other SD card to the other EMSK. It will run the NCP example. Press the reset button to reboot it. Wait for loading boot.bin from SD card.
 *         - Enter **2** and press Enter button in the NCP's Tera Term.
 *         - After entering **2** in the NCP's Tera Term, the NCP will start up automatically.
 *           It will show you some messy code in the last line, just ignore it.
 *         - Install and Run OpenThread wpantund, and join the NCP to the Thread network created by CLI. See README.md for more information.
 *         - Ping to each other between Linux host and CLI Node.
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Extra Comments
 *     * Use AC adapter to ensure a steady power supply.
 *     * The self-boot mode preparation is included in the above steps.
 *     * “make run” is not supported because EMSK boards are both v2.x and it can lead to conflict.
 *       See \ref sect_example_usage_HowToDebugMultiBoards "how to debug multiple boards in embARC" for more information.
 *     * Enter number to generate the pseudo-random number for OpenThread. Recommend enter number in order, such as “1”, “2” and “3”.
 *       Using same number in different nodes may lead error.
 *     * Make sure the compiler configuration (TOOLCHAIN, BD_VER, CUR_CORE) of the secondary bootloader and bin file.
 *       For example, the bootloader for EMSK 2.3/ARCEM7D cannot boot the program for EMSK 2.3/ARCEM11D.
